# mytetra_sync
### What is it?
It's my database (if i can call it so) of useful information i'd like to save and not to lose.
### How to open it?
Install PIM (Personal Information Manager) MyTetra from this [site](https://webhamster.ru/site/page/index/articles/projectcode/460) or build it from [source](https://github.com/xintrea/mytetra_dev)  
Clone this repo into /data (after deleting everything if there was something), assuming MyTetra installation is root
Open/restart MyTetra  

You can also setup synchronization, but i don't think you'll need my database, when there are a much [better organized ones](https://webhamster.ru/site/page/index/articles/projectcode/460).
